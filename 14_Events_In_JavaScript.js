/**
 *      Events In Javascript  
 *      
 *  HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

    When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

    An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.


    Here are some examples of HTML events:

        An HTML web page has finished loading
        An HTML input field was changed
        An HTML button was clicked


    Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

    JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

    HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

     4 ways of writing Events in JavaScript

 1: using inline events alert();
 2: By Calling a funcion (We already seen and most common way of writing) 
 3: using Inline events (HTML onclick="" property and element.onclick)
 4: using Event Listeners (addEventListener and IE's attachEvent)
